Define and run migrations, like this one setting a default value for users:

export const setDefaultValue = migrations.define({
  table: "users",
  migrateOne: async (ctx, user) => {
    if (user.optionalField === undefined) {
      await ctx.db.patch(user._id, { optionalField: "default" });
    }
  },
});

You can then run it programmatically or from the CLI. See below.

Migrations allow you to define functions that run on all documents in a table (or a specified subset). They run in batches asynchronously (online migration).

The component tracks the migrations state so it can avoid running twice, pick up where it left off (in the case of a bug or failure along the way), and expose the migration state in realtime via Convex queries.

See the migration primer post for a conceptual overview of online vs. offline migrations. If your migration is trivial and you're moving fast, also check out lightweight migrations in the dashboard.

Typical steps for doing a migration:

Modify your schema to allow old and new values. Typically this is adding a new optional field or marking a field as optional so it can be deleted. As part of this, update your code to handle both versions.
Define a migration to change the data to the new schema.
Push the migration and schema changes.
Run the migration(s) to completion.
Modify your schema and code to assume the new value. Pushing this change will only succeed once all the data matches the new schema. This is the default behavior for Convex, unless you disable schema validation.
See this Stack post for walkthroughs of common use cases.

Pre-requisite: Convex#
You'll need an existing Convex project to use the component. Convex is a hosted backend platform, including a database, serverless functions, and a ton more you can learn about here.

Run npm create convex or follow any of the quickstarts to set one up.

Installation#
Install the component package:

npm install @convex-dev/migrations

Create a convex.config.ts file in your app's convex/ folder and install the component by calling use:

// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import migrations from "@convex-dev/migrations/convex.config.js";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(migrations);

export default app;

Initialization#
Examples below are assuming the code is in convex/migrations.ts. This is not a requirement. If you want to use a different file, make sure to change the examples below from internal.migrations.* to your new file name, like internal.myFolder.myMigrationsFile.* or CLI arguments like migrations:* to myFolder/myMigrationsFile:*.

import { Migrations } from "@convex-dev/migrations";
import { components } from "./_generated/api.js";
import { DataModel } from "./_generated/dataModel.js";

export const migrations = new Migrations<DataModel>(components.migrations);
export const run = migrations.runner();

The type parameter DataModel is optional. It provides type safety for migration definitions. As always, database operations in migrations will abide by your schema definition at runtime. Note: if you use custom functions to override internalMutation, see below.

Define migrations#
Within the migrateOne function, you can write code to modify a single document in the specified table. Making changes is optional, and you can also read and write to other tables from this function.

export const setDefaultValue = migrations.define({
  table: "myTable",
  migrateOne: async (ctx, doc) => {
    if (doc.optionalField === undefined) {
      await ctx.db.patch(doc._id, { optionalField: "default" });
    }
  },
});

Shorthand syntax#
Since the most common migration involves patching each document, if you return an object, it will be applied as a patch automatically.

export const clearField = migrations.define({
  table: "myTable",
  migrateOne: () => ({ optionalField: undefined }),
});
// is equivalent to `await ctx.db.patch(doc._id, { optionalField: undefined })`

Migrating a subset of a table using an index#
If you only want to migrate a range of documents, you can avoid processing the whole table by specifying a customRange. You can use any existing index you have on the table, or the built-in by_creation_time index.

export const validateRequiredField = migrations.define({
  table: "myTable",
  customRange: (query) =>
    query.withIndex("by_requiredField", (q) => q.eq("requiredField", "")),
  migrateOne: async (_ctx, doc) => {
    console.log("Needs fixup: " + doc._id);
    // Shorthand for patching
    return { requiredField: "<unknown>" };
  },
});

Running migrations one at a time#
Using the Dashboard or CLI#
To define a one-off function to run a single migration, pass a reference to it:

export const runIt = migrations.runner(internal.migrations.setDefaultValue);

To run it from the CLI:

npx convex run convex/migrations.ts:runIt # or shorthand: migrations:runIt

Note: pass the --prod argument to run this and below commands in production

Running it from the dashboard:

Dashboard screenshot

You can also expose a general-purpose function to run your migrations. For example, in convex/migrations.ts add:

export const run = migrations.runner();

Then run it with the function name:

npx convex run migrations:run '{fn: "migrations:setDefaultValue"}'

See below for a way to just pass setDefaultValue.

Programmatically#
You can also run migrations from other Convex mutations or actions:

await migrations.runOne(ctx, internal.example.setDefaultValue);

Behavior#
If it is already running it will refuse to start another duplicate worker.
If it had previously failed on some batch, it will continue from that batch unless you manually specify cursor.
If you provide an explicit cursor (null means to start at the beginning), it will start from there.
If you pass true for dryRun then it will run one batch and then throw, so no changes are committed, and you can see what it would have done. See below This is good for validating it does what you expect.
Running migrations serially#
You can run a series of migrations in order. This is useful if some migrations depend on previous ones, or if you keep a running list of all migrations that should run on the next deployment.

Using the Dashboard or CLI#
You can also pass a list of migrations to runner to have it run a series of migrations instead of just one:

export const runAll = migrations.runner([
  internal.migrations.setDefaultValue,
  internal.migrations.validateRequiredField,
  internal.migrations.convertUnionField,
]);

Then just run:

npx convex run migrations:runAll # migrations:runAll is equivalent to convex/migrations.ts:runAll on the CLI

With the runner functions, you can pass a "next" argument to run a series of migrations after the first:

npx convex run migrations:runIt '{next:["migrations:clearField"]}'
# OR
npx convex run migrations:run '{fn: "migrations:setDefaultValue", next:["migrations:clearField"]}'

Programmatically#
await migrations.runSerially(ctx, [
  internal.migrations.setDefaultValue,
  internal.migrations.validateRequiredField,
  internal.migrations.convertUnionField,
]);

Behavior#
If a migration is already in progress when attempted, it will no-op.
If a migration had already completed, it will skip it.
If a migration had partial progress, it will resume from where it left off.
If a migration fails or is canceled, it will not continue on, in case you had some dependencies between the migrations. Call the series again to retry.
Note: if you start multiple serial migrations, the behavior is:

If they don't overlap on functions, they will happily run in parallel.
If they have a function in common and one completes before the other attempts it, the second will just skip it.
If they have a function in common and one is in progress, the second will no-op and not run any further migrations in its series.
Operations#
Test a migration with dryRun#
Before running a migration that may irreversibly change data, you can validate a batch by passing dryRun to any runner or runOne command:

npx convex run migrations:runIt '{dryRun: true}'

Restart a migration#
Pass null for the cursor to force a migration to start over.

npx convex run migrations:runIt '{cursor: null}'

You can also pass in any valid cursor to start from. You can find valid cursors in the response of calls to getStatus. This can allow retrying a migration from a known good point as you iterate on the code.

Stop a migration#
You can stop a migration from the CLI or dashboard, calling the component API directly:

npx convex run --component migrations lib:cancel '{name: "migrations:myMigration"}'

Or via migrations.cancel programatically.

await migrations.cancel(ctx, internal.migrations.myMigration);

Get the status of migrations#
To see the live status of migrations as they progress, you can query it via the CLI:

npx convex run --component migrations lib:getStatus --watch

The --watch will live-update the status as it changes. Or programmatically:

const status: MigrationStatus[] = await migrations.getStatus(ctx, {
  limit: 10,
});
// or
const status: MigrationStatus[] = await migrations.getStatus(ctx, {
  migrations: [
    internal.migrations.setDefaultValue,
    internal.migrations.validateRequiredField,
    internal.migrations.convertUnionField,
  ],
});

The type is annotated to avoid circular type dependencies, for instance if you are returning the result from a query that is defined in the same file as the referenced migrations.

Running migrations as part of a production deploy#
As part of your build and deploy command, you can chain the corresponding npx convex run command, such as:

npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build' && npx convex run convex/migrations.ts:runAll --prod

Configuration options#
Override the internalMutation to apply custom DB behavior#
You can customize which internalMutation implementation the underly migration should use.

This might be important if you use custom functions to intercept database writes to apply validation or trigger operations on changes.

Assuming you define your own internalMutation in convex/functions.ts:

import { internalMutation } from "./functions";
import { Migrations } from "@convex-dev/migrations";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

export const migrations = new Migrations(components.migrations, {
  internalMutation,
});

See this article for more information on usage and advanced patterns.

Custom batch size#
The component will fetch your data in batches of 100, and call your function on each document in a batch. If you want to change the batch size, you can specify it. This can be useful if your documents are large, to avoid running over the transaction limit, or if your documents are updating frequently and you are seeing OCC conflicts while migrating.

export const clearField = migrations.define({
  table: "myTable",
  batchSize: 10,
  migrateOne: () => ({ optionalField: undefined }),
});

You can also override this batch size for an individual invocation:

await migrations.runOne(ctx, internal.migrations.clearField, {
  batchSize: 1,
});

Parallelizing batches#
Each batch is processed serially, but within a batch you can have each migrateOne call run in parallel if you pass parallelize: true. If you do so, ensure your callback doesn't assume that each call is isolated. For instance, if each call reads then updates the same counter, then multiple functions in the same batch could read the same counter value, and get off by one. As a result, migrations are run serially by default.

export const clearField = migrations.define({
  table: "myTable",
  parallelize: true,
  migrateOne: () => ({ optionalField: undefined }),
});

Shorthand running syntax:#
For those that don't want to type out migrations:myNewMigration every time they run a migration from the CLI or dashboard, especially if you define your migrations elsewhere like ops/db/migrations:myNewMigration, you can configure a prefix:

export const migrations = new Migrations(components.migrations, {
  internalMigration,
  migrationsLocationPrefix: "migrations:",
});

And then just call:

npx convex run migrations:run '{fn: "myNewMutation", next: ["myNextMutation"]}'

Or in code:

await migrations.getStatus(ctx, { migrations: ["myNewMutation"] });
await migrations.cancel(ctx, "myNewMutation");
